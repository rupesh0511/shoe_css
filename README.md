in html part first of all i have used div tag to make a container then inside that anither div tag backcontainer inside that 
subcontainer and inside that i created two more divs .And used h1 and p tag inside one div and img tag inside another.

As for the css part i gave container height and width according to assignment and used position property to make it positioned 
and used transform to make it exactly same
And given height width to other divs as per assignment and back ground colors and used position property on backcontainer.And 
used margin color top left properties to make it as similar as possible.And more importantly i have also used and learned about hover 
to give effects to my image.
